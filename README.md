**Mammouth AI Theme Customizer 🎨**
==========================

A Chrome extension that lets you take control of the Mammouth AI theme and make it your own 🙌.

I created this extension because, let's be honest, the default white theme can be a bit harsh on the eyes 😅. But with this extension, you can customize the background color, text color, and other elements to create a look and feel that's all you 🎉.

**Introduction 📚**
---------------

Mammouth AI is an amazing tool, but its default theme might not be everyone's cup of tea 🍵. That's where this extension comes in - it lets you personalize the site to your liking, with a wide range of colors to choose from 🌈.

**Features 🚀**
------------

* Customize the background color, text color, and other elements of the Mammouth AI site
* Choose from a wide range of colors to create a unique look and feel that's all yours 🎨
